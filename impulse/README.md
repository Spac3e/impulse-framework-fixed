# Welcome to impulse
impulse is a Semi-Serious roleplay framework for Garry's Mod.

## Working with impulse
[Check out the docs](https://vingard.github.io/impulsedocs/). If you want to just get started read the ['Installing impulse' guide](https://vingard.github.io/impulsedocs/topics/00-installing.md.html). **The docs are VERY incomplete! Look through (search) the source code of the framework for full documentation!**

### Schemas
* Vingard removed everything on his github, but you can still se re-upload schemas and plugins.

### Understanding the builds load process
Currently, the build load process is very simple. The framework will look for a file called config.yml in the data folder, and if it exists it will merge it with the default developer database configuration. This system will probably be updated at some point to allow to to apply to config objects and other things.

### Known issues
data/config.yml will cause an error on load if its is empty!
